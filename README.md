# sscs-bulk-scan
Project to manage the Bulk Scan transformation for SSCS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/sscs-bulk-scan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/sscs-bulk-scan)

## Building and deploying the application

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew assemble
```

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the distribution (created in `build/install/sscs-bulk-scan` directory)
by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `8090` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:8090/health
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
  {"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":249644974080,"free":137188298752,"threshold":10485760}}
```

### Alternative script to run application

To skip all the setting up and building, just execute the following command:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh
```

For more information:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh -h
```

Script includes bare minimum environment variables necessary to start api instance. Whenever any variable is changed or any other script regarding docker image/container build, the suggested way to ensure all is cleaned up properly is by this command:

```bash
docker-compose rm
```

It clears stopped containers correctly. Might consider removing clutter of images too, especially the ones fiddled with:

```bash
docker images

docker image rm <image-id>
```

There is no need to remove postgres and java or similar core images.

## Testing End To End With Excela or Bulk Scan Processor

To test the service fully end to end with Excela or the Bulk Scan Processor service then there are 2 options:

1. Push your change to Demo environment and get the BSP team to push through some test data on CCD.
2. Configure your local setup using these instructions:

## Import Test Data

```bash
bin/import-test-data.sh
```
